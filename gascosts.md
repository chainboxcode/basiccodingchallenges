1. Transfering ether: This transaction typically involves a simple transfer of Ether from one address to another. It involves a basic value transfer and does not require complex operations or additional contract interactions. Therefore, it generally consumes a relatively low amount of gas compared to other transactions.

2. Transfering USDC: This transaction involves transferring the USDC (USD Coin) token, which is an ERC20 token. ERC20 token transfers typically require a bit more gas compared to a basic Ether transfer because they involve additional operations such as updating balances and approvals within the token contract.

3.Minting an NFT: Minting an NFT (Non-Fungible Token) typically requires more gas compared to basic transfers. It involves creating a unique token, which often requires additional data storage, state updates, and potentially the execution of complex logic within the NFT contract.

4. Swapping ERC20 tokens on a DEX: Swapping ERC20 tokens on a decentralized exchange (DEX) involves interacting with a smart contract that handles the token swap. This transaction typically involves multiple steps, including approving the token transfer, interacting with the DEX contract, and updating token balances. The gas consumption can vary depending on the complexity of the DEX contract and the specific swapping logic involved.

5. Transferring an NFT: Transferring an NFT from one address to another typically consumes a higher amount of gas compared to the other transactions mentioned. It requires updating ownership and state information within the NFT contract, which can involve more complex operations compared to simple value transfers.
